# AI Prompts for Git & Markdown

This collection contains prompts for generating professional Git commit messages
and Markdown documents using AI.

## Prompts

This suite includes the following prompts:

- `markdown_strict_prompt.txt`: For generating clean, production-ready Markdown
  that passes all `markdownlint` rules.
- `markdown_relaxed_prompt.txt`: For generating readable Markdown with a more
  flexible, non-linted style.

## Usage

    `markdown_strict_prompt.txt`).
2.  Provide the prompt to your preferred AI model.
3.  Follow the instructions within the prompt.
