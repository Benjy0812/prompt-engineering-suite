# Contributing to The Project

First off, thank you for considering contributing! We appreciate your help in
improving the Prompt Engineering Suite.

## Local Development

While not strictly required, you can use the following tools to help maintain
consistency in your contributions.

### Formatting

We highly recommend using Prettier to ensure consistent formatting across the
project. To check if your files meet basic formatting standards:

```sh
npx prettier --check "**/*.md"
```

To automatically fix formatting issues:

```sh
npx prettier --write "**/*.md"
```

### Linting

To check for structural or syntax recommendations:

```sh
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your feature branch
   (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
2. Commit your changes and ensure they are clear and well-documented.
3. Push to your branch and open a Pull Request.
4. **Review**: A maintainer will review your work and provide feedback if
   necessary.
