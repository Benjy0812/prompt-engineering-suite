high-quality prompts.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Prompt Architect Agent** is a meta-prompt. It uses senior-level
engineering principles to draft and structure new AI instructions. It ensures
that every prompt added to your suite is consistent, professional, and optimized
for LLM reasoning.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Persona Injection:** Automatically assigns high-authority roles to the AI.
- **Structural Consistency:** Drafts prompts using a standardized format for
  ease of use.
- **Agentic Logic:** Structures instructions to favor "Step-by-Step" execution.
- **Professional Standard:** Generates files that are ready for immediate use.

## 🛠 Usage

1. **Input:** Define the task (e.g., "Create a prompt for SQL optimization").
2. **Generation:** The Architect generates a full `.md` file following the
   suite's conventions.
3. **Save:** Place the output in the appropriate category folder of your
   repository.
