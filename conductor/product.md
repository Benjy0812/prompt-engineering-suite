# Product Guide - Prompt Engineering Suite

## Initial Concept
A curated collection of text-based prompts designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini and Claude. This suite aims to standardize and enhance the output of LLMs for common development and documentation tasks.

## Target Users
- **Software Developers**: Seeking to automate repetitive coding, testing, and documentation tasks.
- **DevOps Engineers**: Aiming for standardized Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and consistent version control communication (commit messages).

## Core Goals
- **Reduced Development Time**: Accelerating workflows by providing "ready-to-use" high-quality prompts.
- **Prompt Efficiency & Token Optimization**: Crafting prompts that minimize token usage without sacrificing result quality, reducing costs and latency.
- **Standardization & Quality**: Ensuring LLM outputs are consistent across team members and different LLM interfaces.
- **Reliability through Rigor**: All prompts must be versioned, documented, and tested for both performance and accuracy.

## Target Platforms
- **Command Line Interfaces (CLI)**: Integration with tools like Gemini CLI or Claude CLI.
- **IDE Extensions**: Native support for VS Code and other IDE extensions.
- **Web Chat AI**: Compatibility with web-based LLM interfaces.

## Key Features
- **Versioned Prompt Library**: Track changes and ensure reproducibility of results.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Testing prompts for accuracy and efficiency across different models.
- **Standardized Categories**: Structured prompts for Git, Testing, IaC, Refactoring, and Code Analysis.
