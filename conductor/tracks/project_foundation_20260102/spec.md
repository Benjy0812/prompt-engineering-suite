# Track Spec: Project Foundation

## Overview
This track focuses on bringing all existing prompts in the repository up to the project's new quality and structure standards. This ensures consistency, efficiency, and ease of use for the target users (Developers and DevOps).

## Requirements
- All prompts MUST follow the structure: **Role**, **Task**, **Constraints**, **Output Format**.
- All prompts MUST use the unified placeholder syntax (e.g., `{{CODE}}`).
- Every prompt MUST have a corresponding `[name].README.md` file.
- Prompts must be optimized for Gemini (Flash, Flash Lite, Pro) and Claude.

## Success Criteria
- 100% of existing prompts are standardized.
- 100% of prompts have documentation.
- All prompts pass basic verification (producing valid Markdown/code).
- Prettier formatting is applied to all modified files.
