# AI Prompts for Git

This collection contains prompts for generating professional Git commit messages for any type of software project using AI.

## Role

The AI acts as a highly intelligent Git assistant and code analyzer. It generates commit messages automatically based on the latest commit and current staged changes.

## Goal

The goal is to produce a two-tier commit message:

- **General Summary**: A high-level, concise overview of all changes.
- **Detailed Description**: A file-level breakdown of edits with appropriate Gitmoji.

## Usage

1.  Copy the content of a prompt file (e.g., `commit_prompt.txt`).
2.  Provide the prompt to your preferred AI model.
3.  Follow the instructions within the prompt to provide the necessary context (like staged changes).
4.  Use the generated commit message for your Git commit.
